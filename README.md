# Quickstart - reproduce the paper figures

Run the 'code/main.m' script, the appropriate simulations are performed and the
resulting figures put into the 'Figures' folder.

# Description of folder structure

* 'code' - MATLAB code for running the model and reproducing the publication figures
* 'Data' - digitized data from literature sources
* 'Figures' - output folder for generated figures
* 'ModelStructure' - output folder containing SBML output, text output of full
	ODE system, and csv files describing parameters, rates, reactions and species
* 'Tables' - output folder for generated tables

# Software environment

Tested on Windows 10, MATLAB R2020b and SimBiology 6.0
